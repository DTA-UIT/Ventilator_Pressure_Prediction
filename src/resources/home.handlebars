    <p class="text-justify">In this work, we would like to introduce 2 of the highlighted neural architectures in the field of object detection, which are: DEtection TRansformer and You Only Look Once. After that, we shall compare the performance between 2 these architectures via applying into the problem of detecting various abnormalities using CXR images. And finally, we will introduce our demo for this work.</p>
